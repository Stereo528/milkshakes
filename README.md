## What the hell?!?!?!

Well you see on one fine day I thought of making a cursed mod, and Grimace Shakes are/were
the big thing, so I got started. After lots of deliberation I can proudly present Moue Milkshakes!

Using state-of-the-art methods, you can now brew, *yes* brew, your milkshakes! Using shake mix and some milk bottles (provided by Milk Lib)
you can create Vanilla, Chocolate, or Strawberry shakes.

### But wait, what about that fourth shake???
Well just you be patient...

The Moue Shake, the big deal, the meme. Drinking this might have some adverse effects on you.
It does use Glow Berries after all, who knows what those things have in them...

We claim no responsibility to damage to property or self when drinking this shake.
